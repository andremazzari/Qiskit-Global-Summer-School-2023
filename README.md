# Qiskit-Global-Summer-School-2023


This repository contains the lab notebooks of the Qiskit GlobalSumer School 2023. [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is an open-source framework from IBM to program and run codes in quantum computers. 

- Lab 1: The basics of the qiskit library are presented. Some simple circuits were built (for instance, creating a GHZ state and a 2-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform).
- Lab 2: Some experiments involving Bell nonlocality and teleportation are implemented.
- Lab 3: The quantum phase estimation and Shor's algorithms are implemented and simulated on Noise hardware. Shor's algorithm is the one that could be used to break RSA cryptography with quantum computers.
- Lab 4: The iterative phase estimation algorithm is implemented.
- Lab 5: Some error mitigation techniques were explored.
